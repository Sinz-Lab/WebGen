Hey There! | koob#8912
!! THIS WAS A 50 LINE PROJECT CHALLENGE BTW !!
!! MAKE SURE TO SET WHAT YOU WANT THE MESSAGE IN THE WEBHOOK TO SAY IN THE "Prompt.txt"
This is a batch script that generates a random webhook URL and sends a curl request to send a message to the generated webhook!
Im not a professional coder or anything so you may see a few flaws in the script, if you do, id love to see your take on making this faster!
Feel free to message me on discord! (At Top)
(Also its probably gonna take forever to get a message through but in an older version i got 1-2 messaged in over the course of like an hour.)
!! BTW IT MINIMIZES ON CLOSING BECAUSE IT HAS TO RESTART EVERY 60 TIMES IN ORDER TO EVADE RATE LIMITING AND I DIDNT WANT IT TO POP UP EVERY TIME AND BE ANNOYING !!
({"message": "Unknown Webhook", "code": 10015} Means the webhook It generated isnt available, dont worry, its totally normal. In the next version Ill set up a "Failed" and "Success" system.
 
Love you all! Bye!! xx
